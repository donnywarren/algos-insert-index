## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Insert Index"

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes two arguments, an array (`arr`) and an integer (`num`).
- Determine the index number of the array at which the `num` should be inserted into the sorted `arr`.
- The output should return integer representing the index number.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Get hacking on the problem, test when you think you've got it, and open a PR when it's done!

### Notes

- Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
